# Introduction
I have created these two projects in Java Language as assigned to me by CipherByte Technologies to address practical needs in Library and finance management.

# Project: Lib catalogue management system
The Library Catalog System is a console-based Java application that allows users to manage a collection of books. Users can add books by entering their title and author, search for books by title or author, and list all books in the catalog. It provides a simple interface to efficiently organize and retrieve book information, demonstrating core Java concepts like object-oriented programming, encapsulation, and user interaction through the console.

# Features:
1) Add Books: Add books by entering title and author.
2) List Books: Display all books in the catalog.
3) Search by Title: Search for books using the title.
4) Search by Author: Search for books by the author.
5) Simple Interface: Console-based, user-friendly menu.
6) Efficient Search: Case-insensitive title and author search.
7) Book Details: Displays title and author of each book.
8) OOP Principles: Uses classes and methods for functionality.
9) Dynamic Book Storage: Uses ArrayList for flexible storage.
10) Exit Option: User can exit the system anytime.

# Usage:
1) Clone the repository.
2) Compile the program using a Java compiler.
3) Run the executable file.
4) Follow the ON-Screen prompts to input book names , author names.
5) View the results.

# Project: BankY (Bank Account Management System)
This project simulates a basic banking system with functionalities for account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and fund transfer between accounts. Users interact through a menu, and account data is persisted using file handling (accounts.dat). The BankAccount class handles operations like balance updates, while BankY manages the overall system, including loading and saving account data. It ensures validation of deposits, withdrawals, and transfers while providing account balance checks. The project demonstrates object-oriented principles and data persistence in Java.

# Features:
1) Account creation with initial deposit.
2) Deposit funds into an account.
3) Withdraw funds from an account.
4) Transfer funds between accounts.
5) Check account balance and details.
6) Data persistence using file handling (accounts.dat).
7) Validation of deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
8) Object-oriented design with BankAccount and BankY classes.
9) Simple menu-driven user interface.
10) Developed in IntelliJ IDEA for ease of execution.

# Usage:
1) Clone the repository.
2) Compile the program using a Java compiler.
3) Run the Executable File.
4) Follow the on-screen prompts to perform various banking operations.
5) Create accounts, Deposit, Withdraw, Check Balance, Transfer funds.
